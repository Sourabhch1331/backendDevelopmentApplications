Approach:
I have used SQLite Database to store the data, update and retrive data.SQLite is a very light weighted database, easy to use and, No Installation Needed.I have exposed 4 endpoints for CRUD operation which are designed with best api practices.
I wrote clean, modular and maintainable code.


Challenges Faced:
I have never worked with SQL Databases so it was new and challenging experince to learn and use SQL on the fly.
other than that it was a very simple task as i have worked on way more complex API's that invlove Authentication and Authorization.


Additional Features if i had time:
I wanted to implement Authentication and Authorization using JWT to maintain statelessness of out REST API and also some adiitional features on task such as setting and changing priority of task.
Also i wanted to implement API features such as pagination,sorting and limiting and
wanted to further improve error handling for different environments such as Dev and Prod.
